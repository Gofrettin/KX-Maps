At the Poi 19 you have to jump up to get the PoI! Dont forget that. 
This PoI is a little bit annoying cause of the fact.
That area is only "open when the event is up",
so you get ported back to the start when you are to close to
the play area, so i made this PoI port point a little bit lower.
so all you need to do here is Jump :)
