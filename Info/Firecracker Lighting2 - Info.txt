Notes:  - See the notes for the Firecracker Lightning (1), they are quite the same.
	- No death for collision here.
	- The first point, as previously, leads to the NPC who start the adventure (called << Lightning Firecracker 2 >>).
	- The second point is located under the first Fircracker to light; unless you have a pass, you may be kicked out of the Exclusive Area in D.R., but do not worry, it's ok! Lol
	- Please, use this carefully, do not complete the Adventure too fast, stay over 1'30'' / 1'40'' 'cause the best scores are registered to the Leaderboard.
	- The last point (14th) will take you to the starting point.
	- Enjoy! :)
