to safe time, i can type here instead of the coords.
so
1
starts in by killing Awakened Inquest, for the Item = Inquest Beetle Notes so hurry up and kill them!
therefore are the first 5 ports !



2 = Inquest Power Schematics how to get: Search the Inquest lab equipment near Dabiji Hollows in the Domain of Kourna.
the next port is for that.


3 next is collect a bounty in Kourna ! its up to you which one you choose :)

4 next one is not in kourna port into the map =  Lornars Pass next port brings you to the steam creatures to kill them
get the item there next port is for that!


5 next is Plagued Struts back in kourna so get back in there and use next port to kill and get it
2 ports for that


6 next one is again not in kourna so port in Iron Marches time for the Ley Line anomaly Boss event
kill it and get Anomaly Spark
since its runnning from multiple spawn locations  etc no ports there you have to do it manually


7 MKII Power Inverter  port to Mount Maelstrom and kill the worldboss golem MKII to get item
thats port 11 for you ! incase you have problems


8 now we return the saddle parts in KOURNA  back to Blish
one port

and the final part f√ºr the achievment is also at port 12 so gz youve done it
